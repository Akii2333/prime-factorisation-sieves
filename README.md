# Prime-Factorisation-Sieves
a few chunks of programs for school project on Prime Factorisation

Please note:
1. The Dixon's method is referred from the paper by Dixon himself, of course i changed some features of the algorithm to make some chunks adapt to some rules applying in Matlab. i will test some parts again in a later time.
2. The Quadratic sieves might includes some bugs...there was enough time to perform sufficient tests to prove the accessibility of the whole algorithm :(...i might try  it in a later time.
