# Prime-Factorisation-Sieves
a few chunks of programs for school project on Prime Factorisation

Please note:
1. The Dixon's method is referred to the paper by Dixon himself, of course i changed some features of the algorithms to make the chunks adapt to Matlab. I will test some parts again at a later time.
2. The Quadratic sieves might have some bugs...there was not enough time to perform sufficient tests to prove the accessibility of the whole algorithm :(...i might try  it at a later time.
some update on 30/08/2022: the bugs are not fixed at all and i kind of abandon this account like forever lols. Back in here to do some projects on Power BI and updated my other projects if i dont procrastinate.
